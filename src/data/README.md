# Incremental data (structures)

Following ideas from earlier [(nominal) Adapton implementations and papers](http://adapton.org).

- [ ] Stacks -- as singly linked lists.
- [ ] Sequences -- as binary [Cartesian trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tree).
- [ ] Maps -- as [binary tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).

Each structure and its algorithms use names in its inductive definition.

During change propagation, these names distinguish independent components
of each structure as it undergoes incremental change.
